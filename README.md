COLMAP Underwater
======

About
-----

This repo is a fork of the original Structure-from-Motion (SfM) framework COLMAP (https://github.com/colmap/colmap) which mainly focuses on 3D reconstruction in the underwater domain.
It supports Refractive Structure-from-Motion (RSfM) when using cameras underwater with waterproof housings (flat-ports / dome-ports), and it supports using navigation data in the reconstruction to help reducing drift in the large-scale robotic mapping scenarios.

Features include:
- Implementation of the commonly used refractive camera models (flat-port / dome-port camera models). 
- Refractive Structure-from-Motion.
- Bundle adjustment with pose priors (e.g. navigation data) in SfM to reduce potential drift in the large-scale robotic visual mapping scenario.

Since the main framework is created by the original COLMAP, please also cite the following papers if you use this project for your research:

Compilation
--------

Building COLMAP Underwater from source is exactly the same as building the original COLMAP as there is no extra dependency. Therefore, please see  https://colmap.github.io/install.html

Why COLMAP Underwater?
---------------

To protect cameras from water and pressure, they are enclosed in waterproof housings, and observe the environment through a transparent window, typically with a *planar* or *spherical* shape. Light rays from the underwater scene change direction when they travel through these interfaces in a non-orthogonal manner, leading to distortion in the acquired images.

Example underwater cameras are:

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/images/vive_dome.jpg" height="320" />
  <img src="doc/images/flatport_with_lights.jpg" height="320" /> 
  <img src="doc/images/flatport_deepsea.jpg" height="320" />
</p>

The planar shaped housing interfaces are referred to as **flat-ports**, and  the spherical shaped ones are referred to as **dome-ports**.

The housing interfaces are modeled with additional parameters in the image formation process to account for the refraction effects.

- The Flat-port parameters:
  -  the unit-length interface normal $\mathbf{n}_{\mathrm{int}} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)^T$. The normal vector points the positive $Z$-axis, with $\mathbf{n}_{\mathrm{int}} = (0, 0, 1)^T$ coinciding with the optical axis of the camera.
  - the camera-to-interface distance $d_{\mathrm{int}}$ (the orthogonal distance from the camera projection center to the interface plane)
  - the thickness of the interface (unit: [$m$])
  - refraction indices of air, glass and water: $n_a, n_g, n_w$, e.g. $n_a = 1.0$, $n_g = 1.49$, $n_w = 1.334$ 
  
- The Dome-port parameters:
  -  the dome center in the local camera coordinate frame $\mathbf{C}_d = (c_x, c_y, c_z)^T$. If $\mathbf{C}_d = (0, 0, 0)^T$, then the dome-port is perfectly centered with the camera, no refraction occurs at the interface.
  - the dome-port radius and thickness in meters.
  - refraction indices of air, glass and water: $n_a, n_g, n_w$, e.g. $n_a = 1.0$, $n_g = 1.49$, $n_w = 1.334$
  
Many traditional multi-view geometry techniques, e.g. two-view geometry, pose estimation, bundle adjustment are developed based on pinhole models. We need to adapt the framework to use these special camera models in Structure-from-Motion.
