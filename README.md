COLMAP Underwater
======

About
-----

COLMAP underwater is a fork of the original Structure-from-Motion (SfM) framework COLMAP which mainly focuses on 3D reconstruction in the underwater domain.
It supports Refractive Structure-from-Motion (RSfM) when using cameras underwater with waterproof housings (flat-ports / dome-ports).

Features include:
- Implementation of the commonly used refractive camera models (flat-port / dome-port camera models). 
- Refractive Structure-from-Motion pipeline.
- Add pose priors (e.g. navigation data) as a soft constraint to the reconstruction, the resulting model is in the same scale as the pose priors.

Since the main incremental SfM algorithm remains unchanged as the original COLMAP, please also cite the following papers if you use this project for your research:

builds on top of existing works and when using specific algorithms within
COLMAP, please also cite the original authors, as specified in the source code.


Download
--------

Executables for Windows and Mac and other resources can be downloaded from
https://demuc.de/colmap/. Executables for Linux/Unix/BSD are available at
https://repology.org/metapackage/colmap/versions. To build COLMAP from source,
please see https://colmap.github.io/install.html.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the pre-built binaries from https://demuc.de/colmap/ or build the
   library manually as described in the documentation.
2. Download one of the provided datasets at https://demuc.de/colmap/datasets/
   or use your own images.
3. Use the **automatic reconstruction** to easily build models
   with a single click or command.

Acknowledgments
---------------

The library was originally written by Johannes L. Sch√∂nberger
(https://demuc.de/) with funding provided by his PhD advisors Jan-Michael Frahm
and Marc Pollefeys. Since then the project has benefited from countless
community contributions, including bug fixes, improvements, new features,
third-party tooling, and community support.


Contribution
------------

Contributions (bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, etc.) are very welcome and
should be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.
